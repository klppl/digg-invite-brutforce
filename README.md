# Digg Invite Code Brute Force

Brute force testing of beta.digg.com invite codes using Selenium with multi-threading.

**Good luck to you all running this!** If you have insights into Digg's invite code generation pattern, PRs welcome.

Tested: 6-character lowercase combinations (a-z). 
Current approach: Sequential brute force with 0.1s delay between requests.
